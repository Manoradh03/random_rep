A temperature converter is a tool or a program that allows you to convert temperatures from one scale to another. The most common temperature scales used are Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K). Here's a brief description of each scale:

Celsius (°C): This is a temperature scale where 0°C is the freezing point of water, and 100°C is the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure. It is widely used in most countries for everyday temperature measurements.

Fahrenheit (°F): Developed by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, this scale also uses the freezing and boiling points of water, but with different reference points compared to Celsius. In this scale, 32°F is the freezing point of water, and 212°F is the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. It is commonly used in the United States and a few other countries.

Kelvin (K): The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale where 0 K (absolute zero) represents the lowest theoretically possible temperature where all thermal motion ceases. The Kelvin scale is used primarily in scientific contexts, especially in physics and chemistry.

A temperature converter allows you to convert temperatures between these different scales. For example, you can convert a temperature from
